title: Why build this site?
---

<p>
	It's become trendy in hacker and entrepreneurial circles to say that "ideas are worthless" and that "execution is what matters."  I certainly agree that ideas aren't enough, but execution is also pointless if the core idea isn't worth pursuing.  One needs ideas and execution (and luck, andâ€¦).  Luckily, our ideas don't have to rely on any one brain to become useful.

	I've figured out over the years that I like coming up with ideas.  I like the intellectual puzzle of using the whole arsenal of tools that I can muster to make something new.  In science, I realized that in fact I liked the exercise of experimental design (whether building one from scratch of helping someone else with theirs) more than I cared about the result of the experiment (the "truth").  In the software world, I enjoy the various parts of writing and shipping software as well, but I still find myself ideating all the time, whether it's concepts fo features of products I have some influence on, public benefit projects, or commercial startups that "somebody should build".

	I routinely share those with my friends, family, colleagues in a conversation over coffee.  Because they're nice, these people tolerate me, and every now and then an idea reacts with someone else's, evolves, becomes "something".  Good ideas deserve to get out from wherever they're being housed, but it's basically impossible to know which ideas are good ones.  I have the privilege of working for an <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">organization</a> which doesn't care too much for secrets, so I figured I'd publish as many of them as I could put down in words, and see what happens.

	We'll see.
