<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
	We've been using the web for years to present slides, sometimes using baroque stacks of Flash players to display PDF slides exported from Powerpoint (gah!), sometimes building fancy video &amp; 3D explorations of slide spaces.  None of them work on phones.
</p>

<p>
	I had to give a presentation on making apps for the web, and figured I'd use the occasion to promote responsive design &amp; related technologies.  I shamelessly and gratefully used Twitter's <em>awesome</em> <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html">Boostrap framework</a> (using a slightly prerelease version from their responsive v2).
</p>

<h2>Demo</h2>
<div class="row">
	<div class="span4 offset1">
		<a class="btn" target="_blank" href="http://davidascher.github.com/apptalk">Try it out!</a>
	</div>
</div>	

<h2>What's missing</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Keyboard navigation</li>
	<li>A new look at the IA -- I had people complain that it was hard to self-navigate</li>
	<li>A real designer doing it right</li>
</ul>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>
	It did the job during the presentation (scaling down the window into a phone aspect ratio and having the presentation adapt got a big reaction), and I'm not working on it at present.</p>

	<p>Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/davidascher/apptalk/">fork it</a>, reuse it, whatever.</p>
