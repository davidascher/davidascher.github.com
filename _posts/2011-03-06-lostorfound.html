<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
You find something in the street, you post it with time and location.  You lost something, you say where and when, and the site facilitates establishing connections. 
</p>


<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<p>
	Craigslist of course.
</p>

<h2>Implementation notes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I hear there are geographical databases that could come in handy...</li>
</ul>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>
	Nobody is doing anything w/ this as far as I know.
