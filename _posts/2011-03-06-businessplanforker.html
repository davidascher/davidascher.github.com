<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470876417/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ascherca-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0470876417">Business Model Generation</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ascherca-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0470876417" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
	is a very compelling presentation of how to think and <em>talk</em> about business models that non-business types can understand.  In particular, I found the canvas model highly generative, both solo and in conversations.

	I got to wondering whether it would be possible to create a webapp to keep track of my business model canvases, and in particular whether I could use such an app to foster contribution by business thinkers in Mozilla efforts.

<h2>Status</h2>
<p>
	Since I first thought about this, the folks behind the book have build an <a href="http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/toolbox">iPad app</a>, which I'm sure is useful, and apparently they're working on a web app, so maybe I won't have to write this app!
