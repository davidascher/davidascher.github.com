<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
	Google Analytics is an awesome product.  Its only flaw, in my opinion, is that the aggregation of data is controlled by a single corporate entity.
</p>

<p>
	What if there was a public benefit equivalent, which offered the must-have analytics features that 80% of sites need, but where the data was pooled, anonymized, aggregated, for the benefit of all?
</p>

<h2>Implementation notes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>It need not be hosted from a single domain -- much of the hosting could be federated and aggregated (which would be good given the complex jurisdictional questions around data.</li>
	<li>It need not be free for all uses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>
	Just a blue sky dream.
