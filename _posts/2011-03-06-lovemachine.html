<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
"Like" is a very successful interaction on the web, but I'm not convinced that most users of said button understand the terms of service.  In particular, I find that many people think it "just means" that they like a page, when in fact it is deemed to imply consent on a bunch of other things, including (as far as I know) letting the page owner publish to one's newsfeed, and obviously feeds into analytics which the websites and Facebook benefit from, but that's about it.
</p>

<p>
	I wanted to explore what it would mean to have a public-benefit hosted service providing some of the benefits to users and websites of Facebook like, but authed by Persona.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy enough to implement the iframe-based interaction, what will be harder is to figure out the downstream value to users and sites which might make it interesting to host and click, without either disclosing more than users want, or making the process so cumbersome that people end up not clicking.
</p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<p>
	Disqus, Facebook Like
</p>

<h2>Design Questions</h2>

<p>
	The current version keeps track of which Persona ID declared their love for what URL.  There are lots of open questions about what to do with that data, the degree to which it should be private and if so exactly how, etc.  For now I'm taking the stance (which should be communicated to users) that this is a loud, public w00t.
</p>

<h2>Implementation notes</h2>

<p>
	There are obvious scaling questions if this kind of thing were to be adopted by lots of sites.  The current code is a trivial node server backed by redis.
</p>

<p>
	I'm finding that the links don't always respond to clicks, which could be me somehow running into clickjacking protection, or otherwise missing some basic CSS something.
</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>
	I have a very very trivial implementation currently working, and powering the "Feedback" interaction with the megaphone icon at the bottom of each of the posts on this page.  Source is available <a href="https://github.com/davidascher/lovemachine">on github</a>.
