<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
	I've spent way too much time thinking about what it means for people to have a <em>user agent</em> &#8212; a piece of software that represents their interests online.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<h2>Implementation notes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>As mentioned in <a href="/actionitembot">another bot idea</a>, figuring out auth across the various communication channels is tricky.</li>
	<li>Hubot is where I'd look to play w/ an irc client these days, although working in coffeescript is a bit of a switch.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>
	I have a very minor patch to hubot which does DMs, teaching me enough about XMPP to know I don't like it much so far.  Much left to do.
